Initial Planning:
1.  Create an interactive Watch List
2.  Watch List needs a minimum viable product (MVP) => features a, b, c are the MVP + extra features:
    a.  GET stored watch list and render it visible to the user. Will have an initial watch list with suggestions.
    b. user can POST new movies/shows to the watch list.
    c. user can DELETE a movie/show from the list.
    d. user can MARK a movie/show as watched.
    e. user can ADD a comment to a movie/show.
    f. move watched movies/shows to a new list for watched movies/shows OR sort list so that watched movies/shows are at the bottom.
    g. different lists for different types of media (movie, shows, anime, YouTube) could help with organization.
3. Wireframe
4. Coding to-do list:
    a. Create my HTML, CSS, JS files and link them together. Keep it super simple.
    b. Set up local server for my back end and make sure everything is connected.
    c. Build the HTML for my first feature.
    d. Write the JavaScript for my first feature.
    e. Add needed CSS for that section of the page.
    f. Repeat c-e for other MVP features.
    g. Polish the layout and styling of the page.
    h. Add any bonus features or functionality.
