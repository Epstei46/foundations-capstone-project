## Description

> Watch List is a personal site I created to keep track of shows I still need to watch, along with any important notes (where to watch, brief info, or who recommended it). This information is stored in a JSON file on the server. Feel free to check out what I got on there and make your own addition if you think of a show/movie I might like!

## MVP

* On page load, GET stored watch list and render it visible to the user. Will have an initial watch list with suggestions.
* User can POST new shows/movies to the watch list.
* User can DELETE a show/movie from the watch list.

## Additional Features

* Along with the title of show/movie, added an input field to the form for an optional comment.
* Changed pixel width/height to view width/height to look better on mobile.
* Made the title of this project a header that stays at the top of the browser while scrolling.
* Created a sidebar image for some extra flair.

## Challenge
I wanted to be able to go from local testing to Heroku deployment without needing to modify the code every time I went from one to the other. My original solution I came up with after doing some research was to set the baseURL object in the client folder equal to window.location.origin instead of having the URL in my code. I later changed that to use window.location.origin to see if it includes Heroku, and depending on the truthiness of that function, use the production or development URL.
