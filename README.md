> When I hear about a cool show to watch, I usually add it to a page in the local Notes app on my phone, with the title “Watch List”. For my Foundations Capstone Project–Watch List–I have made a webpage where the list will look better and be stored online, and I have the ability to ADD to the list and DELETE from that list. So if I leave the page and come back, I can see that my changes were saved.
